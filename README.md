# Car-Data-Complete
This is the most complete car database ever and it is updated yearly.
So I ran into a problem as a full stack web developer, when a client asked me to build him a Car Data User Form.
The form should have three (3) dropdown fields named Vehicle Year, Make, and Model.
And we all know that you cannot get stuff like this for free online.
So, unless you wanna spend decades making your very own comma separated value (.csv) file to create this sort of thing;
I have done it for you.

And unless you really wanna enrich the fucking business community out there who wanna make some quick cash over their database,
I strongly suggest you use mine.

Screw the following: CarQuery, The Vehicle Data API!
Fuck Teoalida, the most updated car database.
Forget APIs they suck and I don't even need to write one single line of code to implement this.

So being the street smart aleck that I am, I never wanted to pay for something unless I really really fucking have to.
It's either I crack and hack my way with fucking commercial licenses and shits like these.

Consider it feeding you motherfuckers out there with a baby spoon.

In my WordPress project, I used Formidable Forms Pro, by the way, I didn't pay for this premium plugin one too.
Cracked the shit out of this fucking plugin baby!
I, then, built two forms Car Make Data Form and Car Make User Form.
You can read all about it here: https://formidableforms.com/how-to-create-conditional-drop-down-lists-in-wordpress-forms/.
Thus blog even mentioned and shared the fucking GitHub repo of n8bar https://github.com/n8barr and his automotive-model-year-data
What a joke, SQL my ass! Like I said, I don't have to do crazy shit like SQL.

In short, follow that blog and then import my CSV file, which I dub as auto.csv
It contains car stuff (Year, Make, and Model only) from 1924 to 2024.

Good luck to all of you out there â€” 3p3US
